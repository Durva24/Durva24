# 🐍 Durva Dongre: Code Whisperer & Swiftie Extraordinaire 🎸

## Who's This Girl? 🤔

Welcome to the digital lair of Durva Dongre, where code meets pop culture and novels collide with blockchain. Brace yourself for a journey through the mind of a girl who's equal parts nerd and Taylor Swift enthusiast. (Yes, that combination exists. No, it's not an oxymoron.)

## Tech Stack of Doom ☠️

- Python 🐍 (Because nothing says "I'm dangerous" like a language named after a snake)
- Java ☕ (Fueling late-night coding sessions and early morning regrets)
- Blockchain 🔗 (Building unbreakable chains, unlike her relationships)

## When Not Plotting World Domination 🌍

- Devouring novels 📚 (Because fictional characters are more reliable than people)
- Belting out Taylor Swift lyrics 🎤 (Debugging heartbreak, one song at a time)
- Writing code that's darker than her coffee ☕💻

## Fun Facts (Read: Warnings) ⚠️

1. Can debug your code and your love life with equal efficiency.
2. Knows more Taylor Swift lyrics than error codes (but it's a close call).
3. Believes that "Shake It Off" is a valid error handling strategy.
4. Secretly thinks blockchain is just a really complicated way to make friends.

## Approach With Caution 🚧

If you hear someone muttering about Python exceptions while humming "Cruel Summer," you've found Durva. Offer her a book or a new programming challenge to establish trust. 

Remember: She's just a girl, standing in front of a computer, asking it to compile without errors.

## Final Note 📝

Durva is currently accepting applications for debugging partners and karaoke teammates. Proficiency in Java required, ability to hit high notes in "All Too Well" preferred.

Swipe right to collaborate, swipe left to be forever debugged. 💔👩‍💻
